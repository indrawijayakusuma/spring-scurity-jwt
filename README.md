# Project Name: Spring Security with JWT

## Description

The **Spring Security with JWT** project is a repository dedicated to implementing security features using Spring Security and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The primary goal of this project is to provide a robust and secure authentication and authorization mechanism for web applications.

Spring Security is a powerful framework that provides a wide range of security features for Java applications. By integrating it with JWT, this project aims to enhance security by implementing token-based authentication and authorization.

## Features

- **Token-based Authentication:** The project utilizes JWT for token-based authentication. Users receive a token upon successful login, which they can include in subsequent requests for authentication.
- **Authorization and Role-based Access Control:** Spring Security allows defining different user roles and permissions. Users can be granted specific permissions based on their role, ensuring controlled access to resources.
- **User Registration and Management:** The project provides functionality for user registration, account management, and password reset.
- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are securely stored using cryptographic hashing algorithms to ensure confidentiality.
- **Secure Communication:** The project employs HTTPS for secure communication between clients and the server, protecting sensitive data from interception.
- **Token Expiration and Renewal:** JWT tokens have an expiration time, and the project handles token renewal by issuing a new token upon expiration.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Additional access control mechanisms can be implemented using Spring Security's ACL feature to define fine-grained permissions for resources.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Security
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Spring Boot
- MySQL 

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- MySQL or PostgreSQL database
- Apache Maven

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-security-jwt.git
```
2. Configure the MySQL database:

   - Create a new database in your MySQL server.
   - Update the database connection details in the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory.

3. Build the project using Maven:
```bash
cd spring-security-jwt
mvn clean install
```
4. Run the application:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
5. Access the application:

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the OPEX Monitoring and Management application.
   
## Usage
1. Register a new user account using the provided registration functionality.
2. Log in with your credentials to obtain a JWT token.
3. Include the JWT token in the Authorization header of subsequent requests as Bearer <token> to authenticate and access protected resources.
4. Explore the various features of the application, such as accessing restricted routes, managing user roles, and resetting passwords.
